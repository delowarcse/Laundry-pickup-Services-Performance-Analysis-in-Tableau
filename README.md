# Laundry-pickup Services Performance Analysis in Tableau
Datasets are from a laundry-pickup services startup called WeWashUSleep in the US. This is a relatively small company that cannot compete with big companies in major cities. The company's strategy is to build a big network in smaller cities.

WeWashUSleep company already has a strong presence in 140 locations and recently opened stores in 10 new cities. In addition, the company recently separated into two sales regions.

Two Analytical Tasks have been done here:
## #1

* Average Revenue per City
* Average Marketing Spend per City (NB: less is better)
* Average Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI) per city, which is calculated as (revenue/marketing spend)

## #2
Identify which of the 10 new locations have the best potential for the company to invest more funds into marketing.
